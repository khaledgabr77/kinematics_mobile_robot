# Mobile Robot Kinematics

You are going to work with the Turtlesim simulator in ROS and you want to analyze the kinematics between two turtles.

## Task1: Turtlesim Translation Kinematics 

Your task is to implement a `TranslationKinematics` class that calculates the translation vector between `two turtles` based on their pose information.

### Steps:

1. Create a header file named `TranslationKinematics.h`.
2. Create a source file named `TranslationKinematics.cpp` and implement the member functions of the `TranslationKinematics` class.
3. In your `main` program, create an instance of the `TranslationKinematics` class and start the ROS node.

`Your task is to complete the implementation of the TranslationKinematics class, ensuring that it correctly subscribes to the turtle pose topics, stores the last received poses, and calculates the translation vector between the two turtles.
Run the program and observe the output to verify the correctness of your implementation.`
